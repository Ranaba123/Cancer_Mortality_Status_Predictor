# Machine Learning & Data Mining Coursework

## Overview
This repository contains the coursework for the Machine Learning & Data Mining module (5DATA002W.2) at the University of Westminster for the academic year 2024/2025. The coursework involves applying and evaluating data mining and machine learning techniques to predict breast cancer mortality status and survival months.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into three main parts, each corresponding to a specific task:

1. **Data Understanding and Preprocessing**
2. **Classification Modelling & Hyperparameters Tuning**
3. **Regression Decision Trees and Ensemble Learning**

## Files and Directories
